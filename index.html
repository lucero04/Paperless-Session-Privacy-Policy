  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 5, 2025</p>

  <p>At Paperless Meetings, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our app operates and what information we do or do not collect when you use the application.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not collect</strong> any personal data from users of the Paperless Meetings app. The app does not ask for, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or payment details.</p>

  <h2>2. Purpose of the App</h2>
  <p>Paperless Meetings is designed to allow users to easily access, view, save, and manage PDF documents such as resolutions or official papers from a specified website. The app functions as a simplified document viewer and manager for convenience and offline access.</p>

  <h2>3. Local File Storage</h2>
  <p>All downloaded or viewed PDF files are stored locally on the user’s device. These files are not uploaded or shared with any external server or third party.</p>

  <h2>4. Internet Access</h2>
  <p>The app uses internet access solely to load content from a website you provide or configure. It does not communicate with any other servers or APIs. All document downloads happen directly from the trusted website you use in the app.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Paperless Meetings does not use third-party analytics, advertising services, or data trackers. We do not integrate with any external SDKs that collect user information.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app does not target children and does not knowingly collect data from users under the age of 13. Since no data is collected at all, there is no personal information that can be associated with any user of any age.</p>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>As no personal data is collected or stored, there are no user records to delete, modify, or review. If you have concerns or questions about app behavior, feel free to contact us.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect app updates or legal requirements. Changes will be posted on this page and will be effective immediately upon publication.</p>
